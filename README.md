english test was quiet easy and maths was unexpected then at the auditorium at 1.30pm college introduce us with members of satya scholarship program 2025-2026 
the conceptb or aim behind this organisation is so noble ,they help all needy studentsor students with single parent or any disability with 70 percent scholarship ,
at that time i also register my name on site buddy4study ,they ensure scholarship for more than 50 plus students
after that there is a session by expert lecture Dr.Arashdeep Singh on " food -a pivotal role in student's overall wellness".
college is a crucial stage for developing lifelong eating habits, making it importnat for students to have exposure to culturally inclusive food choices
